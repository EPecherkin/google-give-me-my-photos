Get your photos from Google in original quaility.

You can't download your original content from Google Photos using its official API. Such a cheeky move, Google :open_mouth:

So, here you are.

This script will help you to get what is yours. It is an automated Python 3 script, that emulates real user behaviour using Playwright.

In addition, you will find a Docker image, that provides UI on port 6080, so that you can log in into your account even with 2FA. Or, just check how back up is going.


You can run the script multiple times, it will skip all files that has been backed up already.
